This a basic setup with Jonas's Generic Mod Enabler.
All mods have been tested with 0.8.6 version
The pack has been tested for viruses.

There is a JSGME.ini which has a property for the main folder,
you might need to change this.

To install/uninstall a mod just press the arrow in the correct direction.

If you modify xvm config or add another mod tool, remember to commit the changes,
you will need to ask me for write permissions though.

It's kind of stating the obvious, but there's NO WARRANTY, use this at your own convenience or peril.

If you are wonder what is this all about checkout these channels:
